# aws-certified-data-analytics-specialty
I have passed the AWS Certified Data Analytics Specialty Exam and, along the way,  I had to do a lot of practice exams provided by:
[Whizlabs](https://www.whizlabs.com/aws-certified-data-analytics-specialty/)  
[Tutoriais Dojo](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-data-analytics-specialty-practice-exams-amazon/)  
[Sundog Education](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-data-analytics/)  

In the practice exams, I have answered some of the questions (sometimes, most of the questions) in the wrong way, so, I have used the references provided by those institutions to learn about the topics.

This repository is a way of compiling references to the exam to be useful for people that are studying for it. Feel free to open new pull requests / issues to add new references or to update existing references (mainly when the existing references are no longer valid for the exam).

Any doubts, let me know: rafaelsantanaep@gmail.com.
